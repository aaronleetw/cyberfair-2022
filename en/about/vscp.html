<div class="innerTitle"><h1>Introduction</h1></div>
<div class="container">
    <p>"Ceramic" is the general term which people call pottery and porcelain, meaning that both are works of art made from heating clay. All objects made from pottery clay and china clay as raw materials through the process of batching, molding, drying, roasting, etc. can be called ceramics. Because pottery appeared earlier than porcelain, many aspects  of porcelain were influenced by pottery production. Although porcelain and pottery are produced from different materials, there is a close relationship between the two. The invention of porcelain is also greatly impacted by the pottery process, and is created through constantly understanding the properties of raw materials, summing up firing techniques, and accumulating experience.</p>

            <h3>1. Temperature used to create the objects</h3>
            <p>Generally speaking, the firing temperature of pottery is lower than that of porcelain, from the range of below 800℃ to about 1100℃. The firing temperature of porcelain is slightly higher than that of pottery, most of which are above 1200℃, and some will reach about 1400℃.</p>
            <h3>2. Hardness</h3>
            <p>Because the firing temperature of pottery is low, the body is not completely sintered, and there will be a deep sound when struck, and the hardness is worse than that of porcelain. The firing temperature of porcelain is higher, and the body is sintered more completely, thus the sound is crisp when struck and is harder than pottery.</p>
            <h3>3. Use of raw materials</h3>
            <p>Pottery can be fired using ordinary clay, while porcelain needs to be made of specific materials, mostly using kaolin clay as the raw material. The firing temperature of the pottery clay can be made into pottery at the temperature stage required to create pottery. For example, ancient white pottery was fired in this way. Kaolin clay can be made into porcelain at the temperature required for firing porcelain, but when regular pottery clay is fired to 1200°C, the temperature required to create porcelain, it cannot become porcelain nevertheless.</p>

            <h3>4. Water Absorption rate</h3>
            <p>The water absorption rate of porcelain is less than 0.5%, and that of pottery is greater than 10%. The half-porcelain has a water absorption rate between the two. Common polished tiles, unglazed mosaic tiles, and most sanitary ware are porcelain, with a water absorption rate less than or equal to 0.5%; antique tiles, small floor tiles, crystal tiles, wear-resistant tiles, matte tiles, etc. are semi-tiles, with a water absorption rate is greater than 0.5%, less than 10%; tiles, ceramic pipe facing tiles, glazed products, etc. are usually made of ceramics, and the water absorption rate is greater than 10%.</p>
            <h3>5. Translucency</h3>
            <p>Even though the pottery body is relatively thin, it does not have the characteristics of translucency. For example, the Black Pottery of Longshan Culture is as thin as an eggshell, but it is not transparent. Porcelain is different from pottery and is translucent regardless of its thickness.</p>
