    <p>The 2021/10/1 Miaoli Ceramic festival is an important festival to many ceramic masters and creators. It’s a way to demonstrate their skills and years of work within the ceramic industry, it’s also a way to glorify their resulting products that they wished to be seen by people. The goal of the Miaoli Ceramic festival is to glorify local ceramic culture that has been a burden within status quo where technological advances are the norms. The total prize pool is $800000 with the biggest prize including $200000 and certificates. The ceramic competition is divided in two sectors one is the decorative ceramic group where contestants are allowed to use ceramics and pottery while the other is the firewood group where contestants are only allowed to use clay in Miaoli. After the winners were decided and prizes were given out, their artworks and ceramics were exhibited at the Miaoli Ceramics Museum from December 4th till next year’s January 1st. </p>
