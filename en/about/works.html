    <p class="mt20">Tang Sancai is a popular glazed pottery during the Tang Dynasty. The three main colors of glaze painted on the pottery include yellow, green, and brown. First, white clay is used as the basis, and it is bisque-fired in the kiln at 1000°C-1100°C. After cooling, various glazes are painted on the pottery and burned in the kiln again. Tang Sancai pottery is usually colored with glaze containing copper (green glaze), iron (ochre yellow), manganese (purple), cobalt (blue), antimony (light yellow), etc. Add lead and aluminum as flux. The glaze colors are mutually infiltrated, and due to the age, some of the colors have changed and new colors are produced, which has a high level of decorative art. However, due to its poor practicability, Tang Sancai is mainly used for burials. The left picture is called the Tang Sancai Horse, while the one on the left is the Glazed Town Tomb Beast.

            <h2>Lin Songben - Bamboo Teapot, Hidden Bamboo Root Teapot</h2>
            <p>Above is a pottery work from Lin Songben, who is a pottery artist from Yingge, Taiwan. All of his work, including the 'Bamboo Teapot', is made from Taiwan soil. Taiwan soil is is rich in iron ore, which is suitable for pottery making. Lin does not add any modifiers, instead, he follows the characteristics of soil and handmade every single pot. To keep the essence of pottery, he insisted that none of his potteries should be glazed. Bamboo, in Chinese culture, represents a term, '節節高升', which is to bless people to have better results in their career, school performance, or life in general. This is also the blessing that Lin Songben wants to express in his pottery work, Bamboo Teapot. Below is another pottery work from Lin Songben, called Hidden Bamboo Root Teapot. The bamboo sitting on top of the roots that's growing under the soil, represents peace, self-cultivation, and a vigorous atmosphere. </p>

            <p>Li Yongming's pottery works are completely different from the previous ones.

Through pottery, he wants to express the wisdom of the Dawu and the difficulties they face as the minority in Taiwan. And also to preserve their culture and traditions. Later on in 2011, he started doing research and pottery works about another indigenous group in Taiwan, the SurTecs. The left picture is named 'Hunt', and the right one is named 'Identity.'

            <h2>Shoji Hamada</h2>
            <p>The flat pot above is made by a Japanese potter, Shoji Hamada. The reason it's called 'flat' is because it has a shape of a gong and it is shaped by patting the pottery clay with both hands before it hardens. One side of the pot has the picture of bamboo, the other has the pattern of millet, which presents a lively image. </p>
