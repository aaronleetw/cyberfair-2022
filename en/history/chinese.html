            <p>The history of Chinese ancient pottery dates back to Paleolithic times. Since the Stone Age, people have been creating and producing delicate and colored potteries for ceremonial purposes. The earliest form of pottery appeared in Jiangxi, a location south of the Yangzi River. At first, these projects were a reflection of their social and economic lives. When archaeologists excavated these ancient pottery, it became an indicator of the cultural development of a society. There were three main types of pottery: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Earthenware can be made using 1000 to 1200 degrees Celsius, and are easy to build. Stoneware are coated with a glaze or glass that is fired at about 1100 to 1300 degrees Celsius.
