            <p>The history of Chinese ancient pottery dates back to Paleolithic times. Since the Stone Age, people have been creating and producing delicate and colored potteries for ceremonial purposes. The earliest form of pottery appeared in Jiangxi, a location south of the Yangzi River. At first, these projects were a reflection of their social and economic lives. When archaeologists excavated these ancient pottery, it became an indicator of the cultural development of a society. There were three main types of pottery: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Earthenware can be made using 1000 to 1200 degrees Celsius, and are easy to build. Stoneware are coated with a glaze or glass that is fired at about 1100 to 1300 degrees Celsius. Last, porcelain is the most valuable project than stoneware or earthenware because of its translucence and fine appearance. By 3000 BCE, craftsmanship has exemplified and more advanced pottery started to appear, such as: jade carving and the development of bronze.</p>

During those periods, many new varieties were explored and innovated for imperial uses, since a variety of porcelains with distinctive colors, distinct levels and rare were manufactured. The designs were very exquisite that are often compared with the carved "national porcelain" (國瓷). The monochromatic glaze, blue and white, red in glaze, enamel, famille rose and other varieties of the dynasty all have extremely exquisite appearances and innovative varieties.
