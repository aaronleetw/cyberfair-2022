<div class="container">
    <p>On September 2015, the world witnessed one of the biggest meetings in the history of United Nations and the establishment of the sustainable development goals. Despite combatting international plastic pollution is never included in one of the goals, other topics such as “clean water and sanitation, “climate action”, “life below water”, etc, do highlight this issue. In order to achieve such substantial plans, plastic pollution has become the crucial step to fixing the environment. Anyone would notice that the usage of plastic soars higher each year due to its general cheap price and convenience. However, our team specifically recognize pottery as one of the tangible solutions and reasonable option worth to give a try. As potteries are made from natural mineral clay, it does not come close to harming our beautiful earth nor does it contribute to any pollution in both land and water. Not only is the beauty and artistic value in pottery is undeniable, but the sustainability and durability allow it to become the savior of pollution and the answer to our problem.  </p>
