    <p>Since the four ancient civilizations, pottery has been widely used for the purpose of cooking, serving, and storage. Archaeologists have been putting pieces of history together through the shape and decorations on these important artifacts. However, pottery art is on the edge of extinction, as it is gradually replaced by plastic, metal, and glass materials. Due to its decline in demand, only a few individuals are willing to carry on the craft and the technology, while the majority of the younger generation prefer jobs over traditional occupations. Therefore, it is especially important for us, the rising generation, to gain a thorough understanding of this culture and heritage, further raising awareness to protect pottery art from disappearing in the modern human civilization. We, as students, can learn about pottery and the technique of making one. Even though we might not end up pursuing a career as a potter, we can still use our knowledge to spread awareness to a larger population and preserve the pottery culture in our society.</p>
