    <p>Due to COVID-19, we could not promote pottery culture in person since our transportation were limited by the pandemic. Instead, our team created an <a href="https://instagram.com/potteryrenaissance" target="_blank">Instagram page</a>, aimed to spread pottery culture to a wider audience and create a friendly community. As technologies begin to develop, pottery production has gradually become machinized, causing pure handmade pottery to vanish one by one. Also, due to the younger generations choosing to seek for more opportunities in the city rather than to pass down the spirits from the ancestors, the masters of pottery making are disappearing as well. Owning to these issues, our team hopes to engage more in this topic as well as publicizing pottery culture. By following our account, you will definitely learn more pottery-related knowledge and its culture! </p>
