These developments are never-ending, so the process has overlapped with different cultures throughout time. If we use the different techniques and the end result to sort pottery in Taiwan, it can be divided into 4 main periods:</p></div><div class="innerTitle"><h1>1. Clayware <span class="small">About 4000 BC ~ 1624 AD</span></h1></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-8 vertCenter"><p>The Clayware period includes the prehistoric Neolithic age and the making of pottery by indigenous Taiwanese. From the Neolithic Dapenkeng culture ruins, Taiwanese archaeologists uncover many pottery remains. This shows that pottery making has been occurring in Taiwan 7000 years ago. The materials used in the Clayware period are mostly sand-filled red pottery, gray pottery, colored pottery and black pottery, all are handmade, and decorated by painting. At that time, there was not a real kiln, so most are hardened directly using fire. The temperature to forming clayware is lower and creates pores, making them easy to break. The indigenous people at those times generally make pots, bottles, bowls, and other daily necessities using this technique.</p></div><div class="col-4 text-center"><img class="w70p" src="/static/img/taiwan/01.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Pottery container without a handle (Reference: National Museum of Prehistory)</figcaption></div></div></div><div class="innerTitle"><h1>2. Earthenware <span class="small">1624 AD ~ 1895 AD</span></h1></div><div class="container"><p>Products in the Ming and Qing dynasty have rich Southern Chinese cultural heritage. These earthenware are made of porous ground soil. They are usually heated to 800~1200℃ to form. There are three main categories of earthenware:</p><hr><p>(1) The bricks and tiles found on traditional buildings. This does not need soil with great quality. They can get the soil virtually anywhere, and are easier to make. The kiln's structure is also comparatively simple.</p><p>(2) Daily-use pottery. The heating temperature can reach up to 1100℃, and began to use glaze, mainly gray glaze. The main products are water tanks, pottery urns, pots and pots, all of which are closely related to daily life.</p><p>(3) Cochin pottery for temple decoration. This emerged as a result of the development of temple architecture, most of which are decorations on temple roofs, walls, and fences. During the Japanese occupation period, Ye Wang's works were regarded as national treasures and were displayed at the World's Fair, marked as "Chiayi Shao". This technique has now developed into one of the most indigenous styles of Taiwanese pottery art.</p><div class="row"><div class="col text-center"><img class="w90p" src="/static/img/taiwan/02.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Chihkan Tower in Tainan</figcaption></div><div class="col text-center"><img class="w90p" src="/static/img/taiwan/03.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Rope-patterned pottery work (Reference: Yuanshan Archaeological Site)</figcaption></div><div class="col text-center"><img class="w90p" src="/static/img/taiwan/04.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Cochin pottery in temples (Reference: Chiayi City Hall)</figcaption></div></div></div><div class="innerTitle"><h1>3.

The body has reached the level of porcelain, but the transparency of it is still similar to that of pottery. During this period, it was highly valued by Japanese entrepreneurs, who introduced traditional Japanese pottery technology and ceramic varieties, and also began to use electric tools. The use of plaster models for production has also significantly increased the efficiency of making pottery.</p></div><div class="col-4 text-center"><img class="w80p" src="/static/img/taiwan/05.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Taiwan Bowl and Dish Museum (Reference: Taiwan Panorama Magazine)</figcaption></div></div></div><div class="innerTitle"><h1>4. The Porcelain Period and Age of Pottery Art <span class="small">1970 AD ~ Present</span></h1></div><div class="container"><p>(1) Porcelain: It is usually sintered at a high temperature of 1300℃ or higher. The texture of the porcelain is dense, the body is white, the thin layer is translucent, and the quality is greatly improved. At this time, the production of pottery gradually declined due to the widespread use of plastics and metals. However, the development of porcelain has expanded rapidly, and the number of ceramic factories has increased greatly, making porcelain grow into the mainstream.</p><div class="row"><div class="col text-center"><img class="w90p" src="/static/img/taiwan/06.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Porcelain Dishes</figcaption></div><div class="col text-center"><img class="w90p" src="/static/img/taiwan/07.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Porcelain Coffee Cup Set</figcaption></div><div class="col text-center"><img class="w90p" src="/static/img/taiwan/08.png" alt=""><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Porcelain Souvenirs </figcaption></div></div><hr><p>(2) The Age of Pottery Art: Ceramics are used as artistic expressions. The works have aesthetic significance and creative ideas.

The initial development was rather slow, about two or three thousand years later than China. Almost all the inheritance of ceramics in Taiwan originated from overseas, such as China, Japan. The elites who studied abroad brought back creative skills and concepts. Until the rise of modern pottery art, Taiwanese ceramics have become both localized and artistic, and internationalized, thus establishing the characteristics of Taiwanese ceramics.</p></div><button id="scrollTopBtn"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="chevron-up" class="svg-inline--fa fa-chevron-up fa-w-14" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M240.971 130.524l194.343 194.343c9.373 9.373 9.373 24.569 0 33.941l-22.667 22.667c-9.357 9.357-24.522 9.375-33.901.04L224 227.495 69.255 381.516c-9.379 9.335-24.544 9.317-33.901-.04l-22.667-22.667c-9.373-9.373-9.373-24.569 0-33.941L207.03 130.525c9.372-9.373 24.568-9.373 33.941-.001z"></path></svg></button><footer><div class="row"><div class="col-1"></div><div class="col-2 vertCenter"><img src="/static/img/schoollogo.png" alt="" width="73%" style="opacity: 1;"></div><div class="col-4 vertCenter"><p class="m0"><a href="https://www.fhjh.tp.edu.tw/">Taipei Fuhsing Private School</a><br>台北市私立復興實驗高級中學<br>262 Section 1, Tun-Hwa South Road, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. <br>台北市大安區敦化南路一段262號 <br></p></div><div class="col-4 vertCenter" style="height: 200px;"><div><a href="http://www.globalschoolnet.org/gsncf/"><img src="/static/img/cyberfairbanner.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></a><p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">This site is optimized for 1920x1080 screens<br>© 2022 Pottery Renaissance (刻文煉藝～陶陶不絕)</p></div></div><div class="col-1"></div></div></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
