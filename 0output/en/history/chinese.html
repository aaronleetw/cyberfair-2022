Since the Stone Age, people have been creating and producing delicate and colored potteries for ceremonial purposes. The earliest form of pottery appeared in Jiangxi, a location south of the Yangzi River. At first, these projects were a reflection of their social and economic lives. When archaeologists excavated these ancient pottery, it became an indicator of the cultural development of a society. There were three main types of pottery: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Earthenware can be made using 1000 to 1200 degrees Celsius, and are easy to build. Stoneware are coated with a glaze or glass that is fired at about 1100 to 1300 degrees Celsius. Last, porcelain is the most valuable project than stoneware or earthenware because of its translucence and fine appearance. By 3000 BCE, craftsmanship has exemplified and more advanced pottery started to appear, such as: jade carving and the development of bronze.</p></div><div class="col-4 text-center"><img src="/static/img/chinese/01.png" class="chinese01 w80p"><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The fragment of the oldest clay-fired pottery discovered in Xiarendong Cave that is estimated to have been made in 18000 BCE.</figcaption></div></div></div><div class="innerTitle cancel"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-4"></div><div class="col-8"><h1 style="padding: 10px;">Chinese Pottery <br> During Tang Dynasty <br><span class="small">618 to 906 CE</span></h1></div></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-4 position-relative"><img class="position-absolute top-0 start-50 translate-middle" src="/static/img/chinese/02.png" alt=""></div><div class="col-1 position-relative"><figcaption class="chinese02 figure-caption">A large straw-glazed pottery made in Early Tang dynasty (618-907 CE)</figcaption></div><div class="col-7 vertCenter h290px"><p>The first Tang Dynasty pottery were earthenware figures that were mainly used for funeral purposes in tombs.

During those periods, many new varieties were explored and innovated for imperial uses, since a variety of porcelains with distinctive colors, distinct levels and rare were manufactured. The designs were very exquisite that are often compared with the carved "national porcelain" (國瓷). The monochromatic glaze, blue and white, red in glaze, enamel, famille rose and other varieties of the dynasty all have extremely exquisite appearances and innovative varieties.
